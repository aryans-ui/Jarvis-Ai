Subject: Application for Sick Leave

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to request a sick leave for [number of days] days, starting from [start date] to [end date]. Unfortunately, I am currently suffering from [briefly mention your illness, e.g., fever, flu, or any other medical condition].

Due to my present health condition, I am unable to attend work and perform my duties to the best of my abilities. I am under medical treatment and am following the advice of my doctor to recover as soon as possible.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will make sure to catch up on any missed tasks as soon as I return to work. I will provide a medical certificate from my doctor to support my leave application, if required.

I would be grateful if you could approve my request for sick leave. If there are any issues or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this time.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]
[Your Name]
